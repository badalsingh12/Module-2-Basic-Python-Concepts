Python Programs: Basic Mathematical Operations & Personalized Greeting

This repository contains two Python programs designed to demonstrate basic functionalities in Python:

1.Basic Mathematical Operations: This program performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers provided by the user.
2.Personalized Greeting: This program takes the user's first and last name and provides a personalized greeting message.

Program 1: Basic Mathematical Operations

This Python program prompts the user to input two numbers and then performs the following basic mathematical operations:
- Addition: Adds the two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers.
- Division: Divides the first number by the second.

After performing these operations, the program displays the results of each operation on the screen.

Output

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 5 + 10 = 15
Subtraction: 5 - 10 = -5
Multiplication: 5 * 10 = 50
Division: 5 / 10 = 0.5

2.Python Program: Personalized Greeting

This repository contains a Python program that:
- Takes the user's first name and last name as input.
- Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
- Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.


The program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name. After receiving the input, it concatenates both names to form a full name. The program then displays a greeting message that includes the full name.

Output

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, JohnDoe! Welcome to the Python program.
